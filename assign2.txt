Assign2: Due 11:59PM March 6

Please take small steps. Start with a canary test and one or two more tests.
List your tests in a file named tests.txt. Check them off with a x as you 
implement them. Remember to ask for a review each day. The earlier you start,
the earlier you finish, and less the risk. If you start late, you carry a 
bigger risk. I sincerely hope you will start early and come out winning in 
this course.

Using test first development, write the program described below.

Write a program that reads a file which has multiple line of text and prints 
it to the console with words with correct spelling as is and words with 
incorrect spelling within [].

For example, given the file with
The cow jumped over the moln and the little dog laghed to see such sport and 
the dih ran away with the spon

The output will be:
The cow jumped over the [moln] and the little dog [laghed] to see such sport 
and the [dih] ran away with the [spon]

You can assume that the input file will not contain any punctuations (no 
comma, semi-colon, period, etc.). The program can find if a word is of correct 
spelling or not by querying http://agile.cs.uh.edu/spell?check=WORD where WORD 
can be replaced with the word to check spelling for.
 
Design the program in a way that 
-we may use a different service to check the spelling without having to change 
any existing code, though adding new small modules of code is OK.

-we may read the lines of text from another source instead of a file. Again 
program should require no change, though adding new small modules of code is 
OK.
